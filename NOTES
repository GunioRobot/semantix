Using BackgrounDRb is a pain since the documentation and examples are so poor. Here's some notes on how I'm using it.

Injecting a worker

  # script/console
  # >> MiddleMan.new_worker(:worker => :feeds_worker, :worker_key => 2345, :do_work -> 1)

Then:

  # bots/background_monitor

Should show you all of the workers currently running, including the one you just kicked off.
