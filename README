This is an experiment with data mining and semantic webby things. Who knows where this will go (probably nowhere) as this is going to be highly experimental based off of random thoughts that enter my head.

Hang onto your seats 'cos it's going to be a bumpy ride! ;)


Feel free to send me any suggestions!
